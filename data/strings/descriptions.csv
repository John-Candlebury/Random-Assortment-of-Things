#Abyss,,,,,,
rat_fracture,CUSTOM,"A condensed area of abyssal matter, it's intense gravitational forces creating passage between the different zones of the abyss. ",,,,
rat_abyss_rift_entrance,CUSTOM,"A heavily distorted area of spacetime. Closing in on it causes the rift to appear bigger and bigger, until it eventualy completely surrounds what approaches it. Something seems to be generating it from inside.",,,,
rat_abyss_rift_station,CUSTOM,A lone station standing in the center of this anomaly. This rift in spacetime seems to be generated by it.,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
rat_domain_research,CUSTOM,"An abandoned research station. Despite cycles of inoperation, due to isolation from the sector it remains relatively untouched.",,,,

merrow_system,SHIP_SYSTEM,"The ship has an adaptive shipsystem that will change depending on the active AI core. Without a core, the shipsystem can not be activated. Using a chronos core, the shipsystem increases the firerate of ballistic and energy weapons, with a cosmos core, it is able to vent hardflux with the shields active.",,,,
chuul_system,SHIP_SYSTEM,"The ship has an adaptive shipsystem that will change depending on the active AI core. Without a core, the shipsystem can not be activated. A chronos core allows the ship to teleport in the direction it is traveling, while a cosmos core will increase damage dealt by all weapons.",,,,
aboleth_system,SHIP_SYSTEM,"The ship has an adaptive shipsystem that will change depending on the active AI core. Without a core, the shipsystem can not be activated. A chronos core increases the ships timeflow, and the cosmos core enables the ship to enter p-space.",,,,
morkoth_system,SHIP_SYSTEM,"The ship has an adaptive shipsystem that will change depending on the active AI core. Without a core, the shipsystem can not be activated. With a chronos core, the ship gets a brief but strong boost in maneuverability, where as with a cosmos core it is able to turn shield damage taken in to several beneficial buffs.",,,,
rat_sariel_system,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Disables shields and prevents any increases in weapon range from other sources (hullmods, skills). In exchange it decreases all damage taken, increases weapon fire rate and damage and improves the maneuverability of the ship.",,,,

#Abyss Builtins,,,,,,
,,,,,,
rat_sariel_launcher_left,WEAPON,A small missile launcher that recharges its ammunition by absorbing remaining flux from the surroundings of targeted ships.,,,,
rat_sariel_launcher_right,WEAPON,A small missile launcher that recharges its ammunition by absorbing remaining flux from the surroundings of targeted ships.,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
#Abyss Weapons,,,,,,
rat_shortfin,WEAPON,A rapid fire point defense weapon that can deal with a variety of threats at a low flux cost.,,,,
rat_humpback,WEAPON,"A long range blaster that poses a steady threat against enemy shields. Due to special properties of the projectiles plasma, impacts on hull can temporarily weaken the effectiveness of the targets armor.",,,,
rat_haddock,WEAPON,"A large blaster that can easily supress enemy shields. Thanks to special properties of the projectiles plasma, impacts on hull can temporarily weaken the effectiveness of the targets armor.",,,,
rat_leviathan,WEAPON,"The Leviathan is a long-range railgun that is able to to hurt enemy defenses in all situations, but is especialy capable against targets without active shields.",,,,
,,,,,,
rat_seadragon_rack,WEAPON,Fires a Seadragon DEMs that unleashes energy bursts upon the target. They are exceptional at making captains second-guess their decisions to put down their shields. Can recharge their ammunition over time.,,,,
rat_seadragon,WEAPON,Fires multiple Seadragon DEMs that unleash energy bursts upon the target. They are exceptional at making captains second-guess their decisions to put down their shields. Can recharge their ammunition over time.,,,,
,,,,,,
rat_asterina,WEAPON,"A small beam weapon that is capable of reliably supressing enemy shields, however it's effectiveness falls of as the targets flux level rises.",,,,
rat_asterias,WEAPON,"A beam weapon that is capable of reliably supressing enemy shields, however it's effectiveness falls of as the targets flux level rises.",,,,
rat_seabream,WEAPON,A burst beam weapon that can do effective damage against the targets armor. It can store multiple charges to fire again in quick succession.,,,,

#Relics,,,,,,
,,,,,,
rat_tactical_core,RESOURCE,An altered Beta Core that is designed to handle carrier specific workloads. This gives it a more steady personality and skills that improve the performance of deployed fighters.,,,,
,,,,,,
rat_development_station,CUSTOM,"An abandoned station, its purpose was once to progress mankinds journey through the stars, being the host of many experimental space ship developments.",,,,
,,,,,,
rat_bioengineering_station,CUSTOM,"An abandoned research station, built to study biological engineering, far away from inhabited worlds. A cursory scan indicates that it has been cold and dead for tens of cycles at the very least, possibly hundreds. ",,,,
rat_augmentation_station,CUSTOM,"An abandoned research station, built to study human augmentation, far away from inhabited worlds. A cursory scan indicates that it has been cold and dead for tens of cycles at the very least, possibly hundreds. ",,,,
rat_neural_laboratory,CUSTOM,"An abandoned research station, built to study neural integration, far away from inhabited worlds. A cursory scan indicates that it has been cold and dead for tens of cycles at the very least, possibly hundreds. ",,,,
,,,,,,
rat_orbital_construction_station,CUSTOM,"Often used by less-reputable ship dealers pre-collapse, these stations can be used to construct craft at a rapid rate and with high efficiency. Notorious for using dubious feedstocks, such as 'lost' scrap or 'rebel' colonial buildings.",,,,
rat_refurbishment_station,CUSTOM,"Used by the Domain to maintain patrols, this semi-autonomous station can be used to 'repair' ships up to minimal Domain specifications- something that is noticeably better than what is allowed with current construction methods.",,,,
rat_cryochamber,CUSTOM,"A station used to keep select useful but dangerous individuals in proverbial storage until they are needed by the Domain. Self-destruct protocols ensure that only the Domain can retrieve them, but the defences may have degraded from lack of dutiful upkeep.",,,,
rat_spatial_laboratory,CUSTOM,An abandoned station once used to study spatial anomalies and eventualy repurposing them for the production of advanced tools.,,,,
rat_medical_laboratory,CUSTOM,"An abandoned station once used for the the process of creating advanced human medicine. Some of it was done in philanthropic nature, much of it was sponsored for support in local conflicts. ",,,,

#Joke Content,,,,,,
rat_jeff_core,RESOURCE,"What at first seems to be just a rat, is actually the result of Tri-Tachyon AI Core research. They seem to have managed to integrate a shrunken gamma-core in to a living being and connect it to its brain.
This seems to have given Jeff the required intelligence to become sentient. While he lacks the required organs to talk, he is more than happy to communicate through the comm network, and is according to himself, quite skilled at administrating colonies.",,,,
