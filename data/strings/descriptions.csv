#Abyss,,,,,,
rat_fracture,CUSTOM,"A condensed area of abyssal matter, it's intense gravitational forces creating passage between the different zones of the abyss. ",,,,
,,,,,,
rat_domain_research,CUSTOM,"An abandoned research station. Despite cycles of inoperation, due to isolation from the sector it remains relatively untouched.",,,,
rat_abyss_beacon,CUSTOM,A small transmitter equipped with scientific instruments.,,,,
rat_abyss_cache,CUSTOM,A lost crate of cargo.,,,,
rat_abyss_outpost,CUSTOM,An abandoned outpost once used for reaching further in to the abyss. It may proof worthwhile as a place to dock and repair.,,,,
,,,,,,
rat_abyss_photosphere,CUSTOM,"This anomalyous object appears to perform active fusion with abyssal matter gathered from around its vicinity. It doesnt appear to generate much heat or radiation, but emits a steady amount of light.",,,,

rat_chronos_core,RESOURCE,"An evolved form of an Alpha Core AI, having performed countless numbers of modifications on its own kind to bring it in to this state. Through research of the abyss, it has managed to get a strong grasp on the concept of time.",,,,
rat_cosmos_core,RESOURCE,"An evolved form of an Alpha Core AI, having performed countless numbers of modifications on its own kind to bring it in to this state. Through research of the abyss, it has managed to get a strong grasp on the concept of space.",,,,

radiant,SHIP,"A remnant of the autonomous AI fleets developed by the Tri-Tachyon Corporation. Illegal under Domain (and Hegemony) law, and an abomination to the Church of Galactic Redemption, the First AI War saw these creations purged from the Sector. So the official histories say.

The Radiant battleship was an outrageous blue-sky design created by some naval architecture unit given special indulgence by a Tri-Tach VP's bloated grandiosity. Both the official and existing unofficial histories of the First AI War never mention this class of ship ever being produced because an integrated phase skimmer could never be stable on a ship of such size. Surely it would explode into an infinity of curiously whorled short-lived child-dimensions upon initiation of the first skip. 

Nonetheless, here it is.",,,,
rat_merrow,SHIP,"An autonomous hull from the depths of the abyss. It can be asumed to originate from the original exploration of the abyssal space, done by small expedition fleets from the domain hundreds of cycles ago, then left isolated since the collapse.",,,,
rat_chuul,SHIP,"An autonomous hull from the depths of the abyss. It can be asumed to originate from the original exploration of the abyssal space, done by small expedition fleets from the domain hundreds of cycles ago, then left isolated since the collapse.",,,,
rat_aboleth,SHIP,"An autonomous hull from the depths of the abyss. It can be asumed to originate from the original exploration of the abyssal space, done by small expedition fleets from the domain hundreds of cycles ago, then left isolated since the collapse.",,,,
rat_aboleth_m,SHIP,"An autonomous hull from the depths of the abyss. It can be asumed to originate from the original exploration of the abyssal space, done by small expedition fleets from the domain hundreds of cycles ago, then left isolated since the collapse.",,,,
rat_morkoth,SHIP,"An autonomous hull from the depths of the abyss. It can be asumed to originate from the original exploration of the abyssal space, done by small expedition fleets from the domain hundreds of cycles ago, then left isolated since the collapse.",,,,

merrow_system,SHIP_SYSTEM,"The ship has an adaptive shipsystem that will change depending on the active AI core. Without a core, the shipsystem can not be activated. Using a chronos core, the ship increases its flux dissipation, with a cosmos core, it is able to vent hardflux with the shields active.",,,,
chuul_system,SHIP_SYSTEM,"The ship has an adaptive shipsystem that will change depending on the active AI core. Without a core, the shipsystem can not be activated. A chronos core will increase the ships firerate, while a cosmos core will increase damage dealt by all weapons.",,,,
aboleth_system,SHIP_SYSTEM,"The ship has an adaptive shipsystem that will change depending on the active AI core. Without a core, the shipsystem can not be activated. A chronos core increases the ships timeflow, and the cosmos core enables the ship to enter p-space.",,,,
morkoth_system,SHIP_SYSTEM,"The ship has an adaptive shipsystem that will change depending on the active AI core. Without a core, the shipsystem can not be activated. With a chronos core, the ship gets a brief but strong boost in maneuverability, where as with a cosmos core it is able to momentarily reduce shield damage taken.",,,,

#Joke Content,,,,,,
rat_jeff_core,RESOURCE,"What at first seems to be just a rat, is actually the result of Tri-Tachyon AI Core research. They seem to have managed to integrate a shrunken gamma-core in to a living being and connect it to its brain.
This seems to have given Jeff the required intelligence to become sentient. While he lacks the required organs to talk, he is more than happy to communicate through the comm network, and is according to himself, quite skilled at administrating colonies.",,,,
