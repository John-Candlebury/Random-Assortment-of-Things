rat_outpost_warning_beacon,CUSTOM,A fully autonomous warning beacon. ,,"A fully autonomous warning beacon. The beacon displays the signature of a major faction and it is likely that they will attack anyone that gets to close, no matter their standing.",,
rat_outpost_defense_station,CUSTOM,A defensive station for the outpost of a major Faction.,,,,
rat_outpost_planet,CUSTOM,A uncolonized planet defended by a faction. They may be hiding something on here from the wider public.,,,,
rat_looted_outpost_planet,CUSTOM,A planet previously used to hide illegal and expensive wares.,,,,

rat_blackmarket_warning_beacon,CUSTOM,"An autonomous warning beacon. It seems to have been purposefully damaged, making its signal almost invisible to most fleets.",,"An autonomous warning beacon. It seems to have been purposefully damaged, making its signal almost invisible to most fleets.",,
rat_blackmarketPlanet,CUSTOM,"One of, if not the, largest black markets found in the sector. Located outside of the core worlds, thereby avoiding many of the Hegemony's trade restrictions. One may find many rare goods here; if they can afford them.",,,,

rat_chiral_planet,PLANET,"A familiar planet, different, yet the same.",,,,
rat_chiral_star,PLANET,"A familiar star, different, yet the same.",,,,
rat_dimensional_tear,CUSTOM,A tear in spacetime.,,,,
rat_chiral_station1,CUSTOM,An abandoned station floating through the system. A beacon is emitting its location to the rest of the system.,,"Your fleet arrives at an abandoned station, but the station seems already full salvaged, with not much of worth left.
",,
rat_chiral_station2,CUSTOM,A station floating through this system. It is coated in some kind of stealth material to reduce its signal emmisions,,,,

rat_dune,SHIP,"A ship of unknown origins. The Dune-Class is a light frigate. It Exceeds in terms of speed, making it a good fill in for any fleet that requires ships that distract from the heavier targets.
Those Aspects are only amplified through its ""Temporal Shell"" Shipsystem, allowing it to quickly send out light-fire and retreat.",,,,
rat_opera,SHIP,"A ship of unknown origins. The Opera-Class is a heavy frigate. The Opera-Class manages to unload as many missiles as a destroyer, without loosing the speed of a Frigate. While not as fast as the Dune-Class, its unlikely that its targets can escape from it.",,,,
rat_phenix,SHIP,"A ship of unknown origins. The Phenix-Class class comes with a strong set of mounts for its size. Those are enhanced by its shipsystems, which allow it to do large EMP damage to its foes.",,,,
,,,,,,
rat_superconductor,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Overloads the ships ""Energy"" type weapons, causing their projectiles to violently release EMPs towards nearby enemies. Does not effect beams.",,,,
,,,,,,
rat_scarlet_processor,RESOURCE,"A processor recovered from chiral remains. While not fully understood by the fleets engineers, it seems compatible with technology of our own, and thus could be used with Automated Ships. The Processor shows no sign of Sentience, and seems to be less powerful than a gamma-core.

This type of processor appears to make chiral ships more aggressive.

rat_azure_processor,RESOURCE,"A processor recovered from chiral remains. While not fully understood by the fleets engineers, it seems compatible with technology of our own, and thus could be used with Automated Ships. The Processor shows no sign of Sentience, and seems to be less powerful than a gamma-core.

This type of processor appears to make chiral ships more defensive.

rat_amber_processor,RESOURCE,"A processor recovered from chiral remains. While not fully understood by the fleets engineers, it seems compatible with technology of our own, and thus could be used with Automated Ships. The Processor shows no sign of Sentience, and seems to be less powerful than a gamma-core.

This type of processor appears to make chiral do well at offense and defense.
