rat_modularEnabled,Enable Modular Weapons,Boolean,false,,"RAT adds a kind of weapon that the player can adjust the stats and functionality of. This feature is currently in beta, meaning that it is largely untested and unfinished. There is basicly zero balance in it as of now. To access it, enable it with this option, then when you load in to a save you gain a new Ability. Use this ability to open the design menu. 

You have a limited amount of slots to modify, after you are done modifying a weapon, you want to finalize it, which allows you to craft the weapon (currently for no cost), but in exchange you wont be able to make any changes to the weapon again.",,,
